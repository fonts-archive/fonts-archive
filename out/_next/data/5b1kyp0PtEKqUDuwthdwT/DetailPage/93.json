Fonts can also be used for the creation of print documents, static images (JPEG, TIFF, PNG) and logos. The cost of a desktop font license is determined by the number of users who will have access to the font.<br/> <br/> DIGITAL ADS LICENSE<br/> A digital ad license allows use of a font within banner ads or ads that are displayed in Web or mobile applications. When purchasing your digital ad license, you specify the number of impressions your campaign will require. If youâ€™re uncertain how many impressions you will need, you can purchase a small allotment and true up at the end of the month. Upon purchasing your license, you can download an ad kit containing Web font versions of the typefaces you licensed. You can upload your ad kit onto your ad network or embed the fonts directly into your ads. Impressions are valid for 4 years.<br/> <br/> WEB FONT LICENSE<br/> Pay As You Go. Webfonts are licensed from Fonts.com for use on websites in accordance with the conditions of the CSS@font face declaration and are supported by all major browsers. When you've used all of your purchased pageviews, you can return to Fonts.com to purchase an incremental web font license to cover your future needs. Pageviews are valid for 4 years.<br/> <br/> MOBILE APPLICATION LICENSE<br/> Contact sales<br/> <br/> ELECTRONIC DOC LICENSE<br/> Electronic Doc licensing allows the embedding of fonts in electronic publications, like eBooks, digital magazines and journals. At checkout, just specify the number of issues. Yet if the font is not embedded but used to create a static image, like the cover of an e-book, you will need a separate Desktop font license. Each Electronic Publishing license is valid for one year. This also covers format variations, and updated versions of publications that are issued free to already existing readers. However every new issue of an e-periodical is considered a separate, new publication, as are newly issued versions of existing publications."}],"randomNum":7},"__N_SSG":true}
